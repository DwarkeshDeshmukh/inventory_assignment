### Inventory Backend API Documentation and Usage

This project implements a RESTful API'S using Node.js with Express, designed to manage an inventory system, customer carts, and discount coupons. Below is a concise guide to understanding the core functionalities of this API, including various endpoints and their descriptions.

#### Index.js

- **Setup:** The main entry point for the server.
- **Middleware:** Utilizes body-parser and JSON parsing for request body processing.
- **Routes:** The application integrates the inventory router for handling various inventory-related actions and operations.

#### Inventory Router

This router offers various functionalities to manage inventory, carts, and discounts:

### Demonstrating the Application Flow

1. **Add Items to Inventory:**
   - Add a few products with specific quantities to the inventory using the `/add-item-to-inventory` endpoint.

2. **Add Items to Cart:**
   - Add products to a customerâ€™s cart using the `/add-item-to-cart` endpoint, specifying the product ID and quantity.

3. **Apply Discount:**
   - Apply a discount coupon to the cart using the `/apply-discount` endpoint, specifying the cart value and the discount coupon ID.

4. **Remove Items from Inventory:**
   - Remove items from the inventory using the `/remove-item-from-inventory` endpoint, specifying the product ID and quantity.

5. **Add Discount Coupon:**
   - Add a new discount coupon using the `/add-coupon-code` endpoint.

### Considerations for Edge Cases

- **Insufficient Inventory:** When removing items from inventory or adding to cart, handle cases where inventory does not have enough quantity.
- **Invalid Inputs:** Implement checks for invalid data types and values to ensure robust API handling.
- **Invalid Discount Coupon:** Handle invalid or expired discount coupons to prevent erroneous application.

### Conclusion

This documentation provides a guide to using and implementing the API for managing inventory, carts, and discounts effectively. Feel free to refer to Postman documentation or directly test the API endpoints hosted on Vercel for further exploration.
